# Top 10 Revenue & Ops Automation — First-Contact Emails (Email-first)

## 1) Paystack (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Reducing merchant support backlog with automated issue routing

Hi Paystack team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help ops/support teams reduce manual workload by automating repeatable revenue + operations workflows. I’m emailing because Paystack likely sees high-volume inbound merchant issues across multiple channels.

One concrete automation point: **auto-triage and routing of merchant issues**. Messages like “failed charge / settlement / webhook / dispute” can be captured from email/forms/DMs, classified (category + urgency), enriched with basics (merchant ID, integration type, last event timestamp), and routed to the right queue as a pre-filled ticket—with a short “next best action” checklist for the agent.

We build this as a service, and can start with a small **fixed-scope pilot** if it’s useful.

If you want the rest of the teardown points, reply **“send the rest”** and I’ll forward them.

## 2) Moniepoint (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Automating business-client onboarding follow-ups (without more headcount)

Hi Moniepoint team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help teams automate ops-heavy workflows (onboarding, support, reporting) to reduce cycle time and exceptions. I’m reaching out because SME onboarding typically creates hidden operational load.

One concrete automation point: **onboarding follow-up + exception handling**. A workflow can monitor KYB/onboarding state changes, detect “stuck” applications (e.g., no progress after X hours/days), and trigger the right follow-up: a targeted email/WhatsApp message to the customer plus an internal task when manual review is likely needed. The key is routing exceptions (missing docs, mismatched details, pending approvals) to the correct operator with all relevant context bundled.

We provide this as a service and can start with a **small fixed-scope pilot**.

## 3) Flutterwave (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Partner ops reporting: fewer manual pulls, faster exception visibility

Hi Flutterwave team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help ops teams automate recurring reporting and exception workflows so issues surface early and manual spreadsheet work drops. I’m emailing because partner ops in cross-border payments often ends up doing many “status checks” and one-off pulls.

One concrete automation point: **partner ops reporting that pushes exceptions**. This typically includes scheduled aggregation (by partner/corridor/failure reason), a daily/weekly digest to stakeholders, and an exception feed that flags anomalies (spikes in timeouts, settlement delays, chargeback rate shifts) with links to the underlying records.

We build these layers as a service; if helpful, we can start with a **fixed-scope pilot** focused on one corridor or partner set.

## 4) Kuda Business (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Support triage for business accounts (category + priority + next steps)

Hi Kuda Business team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help support/ops teams reduce handling time by automating triage, routing, and customer updates. I’m reaching out because business-banking support tends to span many categories and resolver teams.

One concrete automation point: **structured support triage**. When requests come in (transfers, cards, chargebacks, limits, integrations/API, compliance), a workflow can collect key fields up front (business type, transaction reference, channel, urgency), classify the request, and open a ticket with a pre-filled template and checklist. It can also send a customer update that sets expectations and requests the exact info needed to proceed.

We deliver this as a service and can start with a **small fixed-scope pilot** (one queue/category first).

Reply **“send the rest”** for the remaining teardown points.

## 5) Cowrywise (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Lifecycle nudges triggered by user intent (not generic schedules)

Hi Cowrywise team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help product/ops teams automate lifecycle and exception workflows that improve conversion and retention. I’m reaching out because savings/investing products often lose users to “silent” drop-offs.

One concrete automation point: **intent-based lifecycle nudges**. Instead of generic drips, trigger messages from observable states like “started signup but didn’t fund,” “funded once then stopped,” “deposit failed,” or “recurring plan paused.” The workflow can segment by state, send a specific nudge (education + clear action), and create an internal alert for high-value accounts where a human touch is likely effective.

We provide this as a service and can start with a **fixed-scope pilot** around 2–3 key events.

## 6) PiggyVest (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Catching “silent failures” in recurring savings before they become churn

Hi PiggyVest team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help ops teams automate monitoring + follow-ups around revenue-impacting exceptions. I’m emailing because recurring savings flows often fail quietly (and churn shows up later).

One concrete automation point: **monitoring recurring savings for silent failures**—failed debits, mandate issues, repeated retries, or paused plans that never resume. A lightweight workflow can watch for failure events and thresholds (e.g., “3 failed attempts” or “no successful debit in 14 days”), then route the case: (1) customer message with the exact fix (update card, re-authorize, retry link), and (2) an internal queue for patterns that suggest a systemic issue. Over time, you get a dashboard of top failure reasons.

We build this as a service and can start with a **small fixed-scope pilot**.

## 7) Hotels.ng (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Faster conversion: automating inquiry routing + follow-up windows

Hi Hotels.ng team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help marketplace ops teams automate lead capture, routing, and follow-ups so fewer inquiries go cold. I’m reaching out because a lot of booking revenue is won or lost in the first response window.

One concrete automation point: **inquiry routing + timed follow-ups**. When a customer asks about availability, pricing, or changes, the request can be captured, tagged (hotel/location/date/issue type when provided), and routed to the right team or supplier contact. If there’s no response within a defined SLA window, the workflow escalates and triggers a fallback: alternative suggestions or a structured request for missing details.

We provide this as a service and can start with a **fixed-scope pilot** around one inquiry type.

## 8) Printivo (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Reducing “where’s my order?” load with proactive status updates

Hi Printivo team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help ecommerce/ops teams reduce support volume by automating customer updates and exception escalation. I’m emailing because order-status questions can become a large, repetitive driver of tickets.

One concrete automation point: **proactive order status + exception notifications**. When an order changes state (payment confirmed, artwork needs revision, production started, dispatched), a workflow can send the right customer update with a clear next step. If an order is “stuck” beyond SLA, it can alert internal ops with order details and a recommended action (contact courier, request revised artwork, re-run payment check).

We build this as a service and can start with a **small fixed-scope pilot** on 1–2 high-volume statuses.

## 9) Remita (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Automating support/reporting handoffs across multiple stakeholders

Hi Remita team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help ops teams automate case intake, packaging, and reporting so handoffs don’t lose context. I’m reaching out because multi-stakeholder payment environments often spend time bouncing tickets and rebuilding the same “case context.”

One concrete automation point: a **case-bundle workflow**. Capture the incoming issue/report request, standardize required fields (organization, product, reference IDs, time window), attach relevant transactions/logs when available, and route to the correct resolver group with a consistent template. For recurring reporting, scheduled summaries (volume, failures, settlement timelines) can be delivered automatically, with exceptions escalated to a dedicated queue.

We provide this as a service and can start with a **fixed-scope pilot** on one case type.

Reply **“send the rest”** and I’ll share the remaining teardown points.

## 10) Andela (SMB Automation)
**Subject:** Automating onboarding checkpoints for distributed talent operations

Hi Andela team, my name is Chris. I’m a Senior Sales Agent with TechGenie.

We help teams automate cross-tool onboarding and compliance workflows so exceptions are handled consistently and cycle time improves. I’m reaching out because distributed talent operations often span many systems and owners.

One concrete automation point: **checkpoint-based onboarding orchestration**. Define required stages (forms, contracts, checks, device/provisioning, project assignment), automatically notify the right owner when a stage is pending, and route exceptions (missing documents, scheduling conflicts, failed checks) with the relevant context in one place. This typically reduces “where are we stuck?” reporting and prevents manual chasing.

We build this as a service and can start with a **small fixed-scope pilot** around a subset of checkpoints.
