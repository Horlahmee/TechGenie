## Guidance (what’s most likely to get a response)

- **Partnerships / sales / business development inboxes** (e.g., `partnerships@…`, `hello@…`, `info@…`) typically route faster to teams that can evaluate collaborations.
- **Support emails** (e.g., `support@…`, `help@…`) are usually optimized for customer issues; still workable for outreach, but expect triage/redirects.
- Where a company **doesn’t publicly list an email** (e.g., Printivo), use the contact form/phone and include a clear subject, your company details, and a callback request.
