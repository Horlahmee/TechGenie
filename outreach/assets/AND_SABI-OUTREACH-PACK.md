# TechGenie Outreach Pack — Andela + Sabi

## Objective
Book a 15-minute discovery call by offering a free 3-point automation teardown tailored to each company.

---

## 1) Initial Email — Andela

**Subject:** Quick idea for Andela’s talent ops workflows

Hi Andela team,

I run TechGenie — we build production-grade AI systems for revenue and operations.

Given Andela’s distributed talent and delivery workflows, I believe there are immediate wins in:
- onboarding handoff automation,
- placement pipeline visibility,
- and exception/issue escalation routing.

If helpful, I can send a free 3-point teardown tailored to Andela’s workflow with practical implementation paths.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week?

Best,

## 2) Follow-up #1 (48h) — Andela

**Subject:** Re: Quick idea for Andela’s talent ops workflows

Hi team,

Quick follow-up in case my previous note got buried.

Happy to send the 3-point teardown directly by email so you can review asynchronously before any call.

If useful, just reply “send it” and I’ll share it.

Best,
TechGenie

## 3) Follow-up #2 (Final) — Andela

**Subject:** Final follow-up — Andela ops teardown

Hi team,

Last note from me on this.

If timing is off, no worries — I can still send a concise teardown you can keep for internal planning.

Thanks,
TechGenie

## 4) Initial Email — Sabi

**Subject:** Automation opportunities for Sabi’s B2B ops flow

Hi Sabi team,

I run TechGenie — we build practical AI systems for operations and execution workflows.

For B2B commerce operations like Sabi’s, we typically find fast ROI in:
- merchant/order exception routing,
- support triage automation,
- and real-time ops visibility dashboards.

I can send a free 3-point teardown tailored to Sabi’s workflow and constraints.

Open to a 15-minute call this week?

## 5) Follow-up #1 (48h) — Sabi

**Subject:** Re: Automation opportunities for Sabi’s B2B ops flow

Hi team,

Quick follow-up here.

I can send the teardown first by email so you can review internally with zero commitment.

If useful, reply “send it” and I’ll share it.

Best,
TechGenie

## 6) Follow-up #2 (Final) — Sabi

**Subject:** Final follow-up — Sabi ops teardown

Hi team,

Last follow-up from me.

If now isn’t the right time, I can still send the teardown for when priorities open up.

Regards,
TechGenie
